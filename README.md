triadR is a program for the statistical analysis of generalized round-robin data, with the focus on triadic behavior. The package implemented triadic relations model (TRM; Bond, Horm & Kenny, 1997) to estimate 7 variances and 16 covariances from a round-robin of 3-person interactions.

This is a beta version, which means it contains most of the major features, but is not yet complete.
